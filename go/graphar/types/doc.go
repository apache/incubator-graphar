// Package types holds the primitive value types shared across the GraphAr Go
// SDK: DataType, FileType, AdjListType, Cardinality, and InfoVersion.
//
// All types in this package are value-semantic (no hidden state, safe to copy)
// and have no external dependencies, so any other package in the SDK may
// import them without risk of cycles.
//
// Parsing helpers (e.g. ParseDataType, ParseFileType) accept the on-disk
// spellings used by the GraphAr YAML schema, so values round-trip across
// implementations.
