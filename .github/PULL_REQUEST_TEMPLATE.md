We typically require tests for all PRs in order to:

<!-- **BREAKING CHANGE: <description>** -->

<!--
Please uncomment the line below (and provide explanation) if the changes fix either
(a) a security vulnerability,
(b) a bug that caused incorrect or invalid data to be produced, or
(c) a bug that causes a crash (even when the API contract is upheld). 
We use this to highlight fixes to issues that may affect users without their knowledge. For this reason, fixing bugs that cause errors don't count, since those are usually obvious.
